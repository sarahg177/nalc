            <h1>History of Ladies Circle</h1>
            <img class="logo" src="assets/images/lci_logo.jpg">
            <p>
            Ladies’ Circle (LCI) has its roots set in England. At that time, during the Second World War ‘Circling’
                was limited to social obligations:
            <ul class="history">
                <li>helping out at the hospitals</li>
                <li>running canteens</li>
                <li>visiting hospitalised people</li>
                <li>gathering articles of clothing for orphans</li>
            </ul>
            In 1947, LC Sweden was founded and was followed by LC Denmark two years later. Contact was made between the
            members of these first three countries. <br><br>
            On 29 May 1959, an important date in the history of LCI, at the Round Table International Annual General
            Meeting in Leiden, The Netherlands the three countries established Ladies’ Circle International (LCI).
            The founder members of LCI were Molly Worley (President), LC GB&I, Jen Ulfvik (Vice President), LC Sweden,
            Margery Coombe (Secretary), LC GB&I, and Søs Tarp (Treasurer), LC Denmark. The Constitution was drawn up,
            based on equality of all Member Associations within an international structure. From this developed the
            Aims and Objectives, these are since then never changed. Ladies’ Circle International expanded into new
            countries and other continents. In 1959 LC Finland was founded, followed by LC Norway in 1961, LC Belgium
            and LC Hong Kong in 1967, LC France and LC India in 1970, LC Kenya in 1971 and LC Germany in 1972. At the
            AGM in 1994, a significant rule change was passed; following which Ladies’ Circle International became
            totally independent from Round Table. Ladies’ Circle International is since then open to all women between
            the ages of 18 and 45. In 2015 LCI & RTI signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the two clubs
            to encourage a closer relationship whilst assisting each other. Referred to as the ‘Side by Side’ (SBS) Agreement
            for which two pins have been produced. Proceeds from sale of pins go towards International Charity projects for
            Ladies’ Circle and Round Table respectively.

            <h5>Local</h5>
            Most Circles organise 1 or 2 (statutory) meetings per month, equating on average to 15-20 meetings per year (as
    there are no statutory meetings during July and August.) Each Circle is responsible for creating its own programmes,
    what means that no two Circles are exactly the same. During these meetings, discussions around activities the
    Circle would like to engage in ranging from organising fund raisers, the charities they would like to support,
    family meetings, conferences, sport activities, etc. Each Circle organises all of the events that need to be done
    to make the local Circles work. Nevertheless, these meetings always offer a great environment for friendship and
    amusement. Circles may choose to wear our Ladies’ Circle pin and jewel (chain of office) to formally open and close
    the meeting, read the aims and objects, approve the report of last meeting, introduce visitors, discuss matters of
    concern and give all in attendance equal opportunity to engage and learn. The local meetings will bring the same
    group of ideally 15 to20 members together, but the opportunities to get together are far greater than that of only
    the regular meetings per month
<br>
            <h5>Area/Region</h5>
            The areas exist in some large associations, where a level between local and national level is needed to
    promote friendship more easily within the local Circles. They also organise meetings and activities to facilitate
    encounters and exchanges between different Circles from the same area and make the link between the Circles and the
    National Board.
            <h5>National</h5>
            Each association holds an annual general meeting or AGM for all its members. As it’s
    hosted on local or area level, during this AGM, discussions are bases around matters concerning the running of the
    organization for the incoming year, while meeting many old friends for the first time. Most of associations also
    hold a half-year meeting. Associations have a National Board to deal with the structure of the organisation,
    coordination and communication between the Circles, etc.
            <h5>International</h5>
            Ladies’ Circle is present on 5 continents, creating the chance of international encounters and exchanges.
            For example, you can take part in number Club
    exchange which combine Ladies’ Circles having the same Circle number worldwide. You also get the chance to
    participate in AGM’s of any other associations in other countries and participate in any of the international
    meetings. Circlers are encouraged not fear to speak another language than your mother language, as the official
    language of Ladies’ Circle is “bad” English. LCI is divided into 5 regions:
            <ul>
                <li>NORDIC: Northern Europe and America</li>
                <li>MIDDLE: Central and Eastern Europe </li>
                <li>SOUTHERN: Southern Europe and Mediterranean</li>
                <li>AFRICAN: Africa Middle East Indian Ocean</li>
                <li>APAC: Asia Pacific</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Region</h5>
            Each region organises a Mid Term Meeting (MTM) during January/February these can be grouped together on alternate years.
